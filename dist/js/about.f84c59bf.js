This map is also presented back to the writers \n            so that they can better understand their own collaborative process, and get an overview over the world they are creating."]},{title:"Why?",details:["Collective writing easily becomes unmanageably sprawling because it is difficult for any single \n            participant to embrace the totality of the fiction they co-create. Unlike improvisation theater, \n            live role-playing and other co-created art forms, collective writing takes place as correspondence \n            where many threads are going on at the same time, while the writers are in very different environments \n            and state of mind.","The role of the ethnographers is then to show the writers an overview of their collectively created fiction. \n            The interactive network graph allows them to see which themes they themselves have been most involved in \n            and which they have not yet explored, and which writers they often interact with and which they not. \n            They also see which themes often occur together and can explore the history \n            they themselves write from angles they have not seen before, \n            allowing them to consciously allow them to converge or branch.","The writing takes place in three cycles each lasting six weeks. \n            During the first cycle the writers write without seeing any ethnography. \n            After the first cycle, the ethnographers complete the interactive map, \n            which is then presented to the writers. Then the second cycle begins \n            when the writers continue to write, but now with the map as a reference. \n            After the second cycle, the second round of ethnography is concluded, \n            and the writers then see the new map before they enter the last cycle. \n            Then a final round of ethnography is made to produce the final map."]},{title:"The Map",details:["We intend to exhibit the final map, both as an interactive web-based map free for internet to explore, \n            as well as a physical piece in an exhibition space.
